A VoIP implementation for Unity based on vis2k's Mirror HLAPI

## Summary
This is a very basic implementation of a VoIP service using vis2k's [Mirror](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror) HLAPI.
At the moment this is as "barebones" as it gets but I could not find another (up to date) implementation of this. So I thought I might as well upload it.
